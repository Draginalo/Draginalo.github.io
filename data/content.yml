  title: 'Hey there!'
  content: Having a passion for game development, programming, and just gaming in general, I am eager to create gaming experiences for people to enjoy as I pursue a BS in Game Programming at Champlain College, as well as a double minor in Mathematics and CSI. I began studying programming in my junior year of high school and ever since then I have been doing my best to be as knowledgeable and confident in the area as I can be. I am also on the Splatoon Esports team for Champlain College and have a fondness for mountain biking, as well as other outdoor activities. If you have any questions feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn or by email](#contact)!
